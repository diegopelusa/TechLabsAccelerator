# Problem: Make a list of favourite ice cream flavours

The goal is to identify the favourite ice cream flavours in a specific place

# The dataset

The dataset (products.csv) from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/tysonpo/ice-cream-dataset) contains a list of ice creams with following information:
- Product name
- Brand
- Rating and rating counter
- List of ingredients

# Is the dataset helpful to resolve the problem

In principle it is a good set of data, because it contains the key informations that we are looking for. In our case products with list of ingredients and ratings.

The set contains 241 entries from 4 different brands. We can consider it a good data set for having a first idea of likings in the US market.

The data is filled from the internet, by collecting product data and ratings from the official brand pages. That makes that the data is pretty accurate in the names and the ingredient data. The rating data is good to compare flavours of the same brand, but not ideal for comparing products of different brands. However, it is a very good starting point to make our list of the favourite ice cream flavours.

Additionally to the dataset of products, there is a second dataset (reviews.csv) with all the comments added during the rating of the products. This second dataset may be of interest to qualify the rating values and comments. But this task would be to fine tune the validity of the rating values, what may not influence much in our goal of having a list of favourite ice cream flavours.

As a summary, the dataset is a very good starting point to analyze the favourite flavours of ice cream in the US.
